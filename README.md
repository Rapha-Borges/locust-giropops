# Locust Image for Docker

This repository contains the source code for building the Locust Docker image and a full integration to deploy it to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/raphaelborges/locust-giropops).

- The image is compatible with linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 architectures.
- This image is based on [linuxtips/locust-giropops](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxtips/locust-giropops) image.
- It's signed with [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/)

### TODO

- [ ] Restructure the project to reduce the size of the image and improve the security.
